# Operate First Services / Open Source Services

<br/>

- Stef Walters and others talked to the concept of [Open Source Services](http://opensource-services.gitlab.io/). 


- The challenge of creating a Software as a Service offering that is open to contributions by users: the contributor funnel of converting users to contributors. 


- This requires another view on the deployment model, where services can be shared by users and versions and the entry barrier to make changes is lowered. 


- This is not contradictory to the Operate First concept, but an extension to it. 


- Services that incubate in the Operate First Cloud can experiment and become an upstream for an enterprise service or just host the community shard of a singleton service.
