# Open Infrastructure Labs

<br/>

- Open Infrastructure Labs is an open source upstream created to be place where open source cloud operators can work together to:

    - Bring cloud operations into the open.

    - Keep open source relevant by providing an alternative to proprietary cloud providers for academic and research as well as general usage.

    - Develop AiOPs tools to assist with cloud operations.

    - Under the aegis of the OpenInfra Foundation, OI Labs is the ideation and research hub, with initiatives such as Operate First and Elastic Secure Infrastructure (ESI) forming to implement with code, content, and reference systems



- It hosts multiple distinct, independent open source projects that are all related to cloud operations. 


- Since the operate first concept is about using software in a production environment it is a natural place for teams that are standing up open source production clouds for any purpose to do their work in the open. 


- It's also a legitimate place to do work on any project software that involves operations. While it's reasonable for a software project to directly incorporate operations into their upstream, things that are useful for multiple upstreams make a lot of sense to put in a common place like OI Labs.
