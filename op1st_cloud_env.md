# Operate First cloud environment


- An Operate First cloud environment is as open as possible—an environment where anonymous visitors can read as much as possible and signup for accessing the environment is as easy as for any other modern service.  Of course all within legal boundaries. 


- The setup should mimic the setup of open source code repositories.
 
 
- Since most clouds, like university or company-run services, have stricter legal requirements, it’s necessary to disconnect the Operate First Cloud from those environments to prevent leakage of data. 



- The environment is operated by a community with a best-effort support SLA. Similar to the best-effort support that community projects provide.


- The cloud environment spans multiple data centers and multiple geographies, i.e. it’s a decentralized setup without hard dependencies on certain data-center requirements.
