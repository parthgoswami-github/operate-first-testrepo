# What is Operate First?

**“A concept to incorporate operational experience into software projects”**


- [Operate First](https://www.operate-first.cloud/) is an initiative to “operate” software in a production-grade environment - bringing users, developers and operators closer together. 


- It is a concept where open source developers bring their projects to a production cloud during development where they can interact with a cloud provider’s operators and gain valuable feedback on the operational considerations of their project. 


- Operate First is a methodology which is similar to Open Source **but it is not:**
    - a code
    - have a license
    - a hardware or cloud


- It uses the same community-building process of open-source projects, but extended to ops procedures and data.


- Operate First manages a ready-to-use deployment of Open Data Hub on the [Mass Open Cloud](https://massopen.cloud/)(MOC) cluster which is available for the public to experience. 


- [Here](https://www.operate-first.cloud/apps/content/odh/README.html) is a list of components that are currently available for anybody to start using.
