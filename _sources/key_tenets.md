# Key tenets


- With Operate First we will utilize open source production cloud environments to allow developers to evaluate their functionality as well as operability, at scale with real world workloads. 


- Developers can evaluate quality, performance and scale, using open source software in an open source production cloud environment, catching issues, ensuring scale and improving operations as we go. 


- Drawing projects into the cloud will establish a direct link between cloud operators and open source projects to provide a feedback loop for identifying issues and resolving them. And where appropriate, ideally moving toward better utilization of Continuous Deployment to catch issues closer to the source, to improve response and drive improvements. 


- We will push operability into a targeted upstream where a wider community can participate and drive an open source solution for cloud operation. Also we will strive to feedback operational consideration to various upstreams to ensure that operational considerations are built-in and robust for the technologies they nurture. 


- We will measure our cloud operator experience against best in class proprietary competitors to drive toward a first class experience for our open source clouds. 


- The environment for upstream communities to run their software will provide a “Best effort community SLA”.
