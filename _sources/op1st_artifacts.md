# Operate First Artifacts / Content / Assets

- All code created in the Operate First Cloud or by other clouds that operate first, should eventually make it into the projects that are operated first. 


- For other code that has no fit yet will go into repositories maintained by the Operate First Cloud Community.


- Configuration and blueprints for setting up the cloud and services are maintained by the Operate First Cloud Community and available for public inspection.


- The operational data created is available for public inspection.
 
 
- The intent is that operational code created as a result of a project operating first is brought back to the project when it is project specific. 


- When code is developed that is not project specific, ideally that code will be put in a place where other projects and benefit and contribute to it as well.
