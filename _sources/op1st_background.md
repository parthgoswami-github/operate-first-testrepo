# Operate First background


#### Code in Cloud


- In the age of cloud computing operational excellence needs to be encapsulated with the software products and services. 


- To ensure that software projects address operational considerations, there must be a new method by which developers experience the operation of their projects in a real cloud setting. This is the idea behind Operate First. 


- Operate your code in a cloud first, while still in development, then release.
 
#### Inspired by Upstream First

- Operate First is inspired by Upstream First, which emphasizes working in the open, and extends it to a part of the codebase that teams typically keep closed, even when deploying open source projects: their operations code.


- Operate First wants to leverage the community contributor funnel of Open Source to establish a flow of knowledge from users to maintainers and operators of software and services to enable the above and grow new talent.

#### Making operation available

- The motivation for the Operate First initiative is the shift of focus from software availability to operating services. 


- Open Source removed the access to software as a limiting factor for businesses and individuals. However, with software proliferating into every aspect of the business - and our world in general - resulting in ever growing complexity of software stacks, the challenge now is operationalizing software. 


- Making software available is not sufficient unless we are also making available the capability to operate the software in production. 


- This is why cloud has become the dominant operational paradigm of IT, and is posing a growing challenge to Open Source. 


- Proprietary services based on Open Source are undermining the Open Source model itself and the lack of capability to operate is the new limiting factor for ourselves and our users. 


- In order to address this issue, the software development and productization process must include building the required operational knowledge and encapsulating it in the software itself. 


- Development teams must build a practical understanding of what it means to put their software into operations, in order to serve their usersâ€™ needs.
