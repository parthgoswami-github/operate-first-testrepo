# Community Vision

<br/>

- The community aims to be as inclusive as possible, especially in terms of the required skills to contribute.


- The community consists of all stakeholders of all the aspects that make up the Operate First concept, such as developers, operators and data-scientists. 


- It can be considered as the upstream version of other cloud setups, where community members leverage the knowledge learned in the Operate First Cloud and vice versa. 

 
- You might call it the Fedora in the relationship of  Fedora, Centos and RHEL.
